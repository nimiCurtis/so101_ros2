Overview
========

The SO101 ROS2 workspace brings together packages for description files,
controllers, MoveIt configurations and Gazebo simulation of the SO101 arm.
It allows you to visualise the robot model, control it with ROS 2 control and
run a simulation environment for testing and development.

Packages
--------

- ``so101_description`` – URDF and meshes for the robot.
- ``so101_controller`` – ROS 2 control nodes and configuration.
- ``so101_sim`` – Gazebo simulation launch files.
- ``so101_moveit`` – MoveIt configuration for planning.
