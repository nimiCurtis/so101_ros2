Setup
=====

Prerequisites
---------------------
- An assembled Lerobot SO101 leader + follower kits.
- A computer running Ubuntu 22.04 with `ROS2 Humble <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html>`_ installed.
- `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ installed for Python environment management.
- (Optional) `NVIDIA Isaac Sim 5.0 <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim>`_ .

Python environment
------------------
Create an isolated Conda environment for Lerobot and install the forked
repository that the ROS 2 bridge depends on::

   conda create -n lerobot_ros2 python=3.10
   conda activate lerobot_ros2
   conda install -n lerobot_ros2 -c conda-forge "libstdcxx-ng>=12" "libgcc-ng>=12"
   git clone https://github.com/nimiCurtis/lerobot.git
   cd lerobot
   pip install -e ".[all]"

The additional ``libstdcxx-ng`` and ``libgcc-ng`` packages avoid missing GLIBCXX
symbols when importing ROS 2 Python modules from Conda.

USB access
----------
Add your user to the ``dialout`` group so the bridge can communicate with the
serial-connected arms::

   sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER

Log out and back in for the group membership to take effect. As a temporary
fallback you can change the permissions on the detected device paths::

   sudo chmod 666 /dev/<leader port>
   sudo chmod 666 /dev/<follower port>

Calibration
--------------------
Follow the Lerobot SO101 `calibration guide <https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101?calibrate_follower=Command#calibrate>`_ to generate JSON calibration files
for each manipulator. Save them to a known directory and reference that path
from the bridge parameter files. The bundled defaults under
``so101_ros2_bridge/config/calibration`` provide an initial reference but should
be replaced with your measured values.

Verification
------------
Use ``lerobot-find-port`` to list the connected leader and follower USB ports. Then execute the
Lerobot tutorials to validate communication and calibration before continuing to
the ROS 2 workspace.

Optional: Isaac Lab environment
-------------------------------
If you are using Isaac Sim 5.0, install Isaac Lab in a separate Conda environment following the `official instructions <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/source_installation.html>`_. Isaac Lab requires Python 3.11, so keeping it separate
from ``lerobot_ros2`` (Python 3.10) avoids dependency conflicts. Activate the
environment when working with the simulator-specific teleoperation tools::

   conda activate lerobot_isaaclab
   pip install -e ".[feetech,smolvla,pi,async]"
